## Features

![](https://i.imgur.com/sLZSS3u.png)

The plugin displays the file name of the binary in the current view as well as the elapsed time.

Note that by default, file names will be hidden. To allow file name reporting, disable the `discordpresence.hideFile` setting.

## Requirements

The plugin uses [`pypresence`](https://pypi.org/project/pypresence/) for the Discord integration. Should be automatically installed by the plugin manager.

## Installation

To install this plugin, please see the "Using Plugins" section of the [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.binary.ninja/getting-started.html#using-plugins). Or use Binary Ninja's built in plugin manager.
